As part of my journey to learn Python through Codecademy, I undertook this project as a portfolio assignment. Using Jupyter Notebooks, I analyzed the provided data on medical insurance costs and generated insightful visualizations. To present my findings, I created a PowerPoint presentation that succinctly summarizes the key insights.

The project aimed to explore how various factors, including gender, smoker status, region of the USA, and number of children, impact medical insurance costs for adults in the US. The ipynb file contains the code I developed, while the raw data can be accessed in the csv file.

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in data analysis, Python programming, and data visualization, further honing my skills in the field. I am excited to showcase this project as a testament to my growing proficiency in data analytics.
